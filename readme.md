# GLN Extractor

GLN Extractor is a simple tool built with Node.js and Express, using `mammoth.js`, `multer`, `textract`, and `xlsx` to extract Global Location Numbers (GLNs) from `.docx`, `.txt`, and `.xlsx` files.

The tool provides a user-friendly interface for uploading files and choosing output options, allowing users to extract GLNs and output them either as an SQL script or a plain list.
